            <p id="contentOneParagraph">A binary search is a search in which the middle element is calculated to check whether it is smaller or larger than the element which is to be searched. The main advantage of using binary search is that it does not scan each element in the list. Instead of scanning each element, it performs the searching to the half of the list. So, the binary search takes less time to search an element as compared to a linear search.</p>
            <p id="contentOneParagraph">
                Now,<br>
                Let's take an array of a student's result number of his particular subject.<br>
                <br>So,
                The numbers obtained by the student are respectively 72, 70, 81, 78, 75, 82, 87, 85, 83, 90.
                <img id="tableTwo" src="tableTwo.png" alt=""><br>
                Suppose, the student obtained 75 marks in Data Structure.
                We have to find this number from this number's array.
                </p>
                <p id="contentOneParagraph">Here, the array is not sorted. Before finding the Data structure marks form this array, we have to sort this array because binary search only works in sorted array.</p>
